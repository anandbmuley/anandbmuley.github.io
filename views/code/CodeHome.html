      I like to write code. I also like to make my and other's life easy by writing reusable code. Code reusability reduces the redundancy and allows us to treat software
      as Lego Blocks. We don't create a new block always but we tend to use some blocks and create something really innovative through our imagination. In this section you
      will find my work related to reusable code. I clubbed them into various groups as : Libraries, Framework and Products
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Libraries :</b> Libraries are collection of reusable code which tries to solve some use case. Its a way of code sharing while giving control to the developer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Frameworks :</b> Frameworks are the ones which contain some skeleton code which we have a provision to extend or configure. It does not give complete control 
        to developer but is good for quickly using the code by following the conventions or configuration options mentioned in it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Products :</b> I created some Products which solved real life problems which I witnessed. In this section you will find them which you can use.

          Have you wondered if we could somehow get a code for a specific use case.
           A typical example is that of authentication & authorization. We could use it as is with minimal configuration 
           and not re-inventing wheel. Software industry promotes re-usability but when we look for re-usability we hardly 
           find code for specific use case. I like to create simple libraries which serve this purpose. Authenticator is for 
           only adding authentication and authorization layer into your spring app. Its a library which integrates with Mongo DB 
           as the backend for storing credentials. It provides APIs for registration, login and generating access token having 
           certain configurable validity. All you have to do is add this as a dependency into your project
