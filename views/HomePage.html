      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
      Therotical knowledge is good to speak about but unless you could do some practical
      you are nothing but a chatter-box. Similarly knowing what to do is good but not
      knowing the philosophy behind it makes us nothing but humanoids. We all know how
      to solve a particular problem but not exploring other ways to solve same problem
      will make us narrow minded.
