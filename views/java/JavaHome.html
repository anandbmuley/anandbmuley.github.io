    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>
      Java is my favourite language of Software Development. Its not because I have spent more 
      time writing Java Code but it is a commercial language which is a perfect blend between 
      readability and declarative approach. I have written code in other languages like Scala,
      Groovy, Javascript, etc. but they did not have the readability and maintainability aspect.
      In true sense Java is the only language I know so far which clearly shows what the code is
      trying to achive. In this section you will get to know the language better and design a better
      object oriented code using Java.
